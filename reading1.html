    <h1>
        In Plato's Cave by Susan Sontag (Response)
    </h1>

    <p>
        Upon completing this reading, there is no doubt in my mind that Susan Sotang (though brutal and cut-throat in her analysis) raises a necessary, irrefutable critique on modern-society’s exploitative relationship with photography. In spite of living in the now, society has conditioned itself to capture, manipulate, and mourn every moment as it is fleeting. In our desperateness to capture the “perfect” image and story, we forget to actually experience the things we document. While it pains me to admit it, I believe that I have (to some level) become one of these individuals. When I use photography and image-making, it’s almost like an out-of-body experience; my fingers have a mind of their own, taking an exceedingly unnecessary amount of pictures as my body maneuvers itself to find the best angle, lighting, and background. It’s as if there is a voice in my head, warning me that if I do not find a way to immortalize these beautifully candid moments, then the euphoria, serenity, and overwhelming emotions of this time will cease to exist. A hangout with friends, a personal adventure, or even new scenery discoveries, do not feel real until I get a picture of them. 
        </p>
        
    <p>In spite of this “obsession,” however, I think that there also exists a deeper, creative beauty within the fast-paced and raw blurriness of my photography. It is here where I must disagree with Sotang’s notion that “only that which can narrate can make us understand,” because there will always be an abundance of underlying, fragile, and passionate stories to be discovered within the broader picture. I’d like to imagine that my images of fragmented chaos help tell these stories. For example, when I take pictures of my Hispanic culture (whether that be on a large-scale like the Mexican Independence Day Parade in NYC, or small-scale like my family’s ofrenda for Day of the Dead), I am placing others within these fleeting moments, where they can visualize the passion, diversity, and interconnectedness of a different community. In this sense, my “artificial” framing ceases to be artificial and instead becomes rawness in a uniquely captured form; a form that I can reexperience with newfound appreciation, and use to transmit new understandings to uninformed audiences .
        </p>
    
    <p> On a broader, refined level, I strive to combine my attentiveness with Sotang’s assertion that “What determines the possibility of being morally affected by photographs is the existence of a relevant political consciousness.” Currently, my social media is being flooded with images and videos regarding ICE, exposing me to the gut-wrenching suffering and helplessness of our society’s immigrant community. But this overconsumption and repetition of content has not desensitized me from this conflict, rather it has prompted me to speak up. I want to go to protests and public events, and document the everchanging movements of those who are actively fighting against our system of injustice. I want to tell their individual stories, their anguish, their perseverance, all within a single shot and share it with others. Because despite what Sotang believes, sometimes what is perceived in the shadows of Plato’s Cave, is still our reality.
