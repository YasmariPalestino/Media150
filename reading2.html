    <h1>
        With ‘AI slop’ distorting our reality, the world is sleepwalking into disaster by Nesrine Malik (Response)
    </h1>

    <p>	Throughout her article, Malik describes the production and consumption of AI content to be this grand, excessive back-and-forth, in which society has built a digital world that is “not just the blurring of reality, but a distortion of it.” And while we’ve always been subjected to all-sorts of online disinformation and manipulation, AI has taken things to a whole new level…one we are extremely underprepared for. ‘AI Slop’, as Malik coins it, possesses a previously unattainable sense of realism, creativity, and freedom that appeals to our naturally-curious minds, satiating this relentless need for entertainment. The danger, however, arises when the unrestricted merging between fantasy and reality fails to remain visible, until (eventually) the former overcomes the latter. </p>
    <p>While it pains me to admit it, I too have fallen victim to the hypnotic pull of this content. More often than not, my TikTok and Instagram feed display light-hearted, fun scenarios (like a pet cooking a full meal, an inanimate object conversing with others, or even an alternative ending for a TV series), that I know are clearly fabricated, but still watch for my own amusement. It’s these types of videos that make us more likely to accept AI, because we ask ourselves: Who is this hurting? Who is naive enough to even believe this? And this is a very dangerous mindset to possess, because on the other side of the spectrum lies harmful deceit masked in propagandist politics and deliberate alterations of current news. To illustrate, allow me to speak from a personal experience. During the first week of February, my friend sent me an image that her uncle had forwarded to her, in which Bad Bunny was seen burning the American flag during his concert. In the comment section, users were degrading Benito’s person and values, portraying him as a ‘fake American’ and throwing racist ideology to imply that he would never represent, advocate, or belong to our nation. This simplistic AI-generated image (that only took a few moments to make) did not explicitly announce any of this, but nevertheless outrage sparked in the form of social response. These are the dangers of AI, because even when generated-content is revealed to be fake, the damage is already set in motion. People are so willing to accept everything they see as truth, without question, simply because it meets their own prejudice and aligns with the ‘reality’ of their own mind. What’s worse is that they then go on to share this fabricated content with everyone else, only further spreading this misinformation. When will we finally establish a limit? When will AI stop being the new form of clickbait?</p>
    <p>	Lastly, this reading brought me back to a course I took last semester, “News Literacy in a Digital Age.” In this class, we discussed the importance of conducting verification processes for every piece of media we come across. We learned how to identify whether there is enough credibility behind a source, what qualifies as ‘full transparency’, and how to ensure that our own personal biases did not conflict with the type of information we consume. Especially with AI, I want to be able to apply these garnered skills and conduct the necessary research to distinguish between ill-motivated, artificial imagery and real, lived photographs. Now more than ever, our minds are subjected to an overwhelming amount of images, at such a rapid pace, and we cannot afford to be blindsided from the truth through AI.</p>
